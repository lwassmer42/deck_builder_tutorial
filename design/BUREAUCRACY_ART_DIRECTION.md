# Bureaucracy Deck — Art Direction (House Style + Subject Guidance)

This is the persistent “north star” for card art prompts so we don’t lose intent as we iterate.

## Tone
- Satirical / darkly humorous workplace bureaucracy.
- Humor comes from *human emotion* + *petty bureaucratic absurdity*.

## People (when present)
Prioritize expressive faces and clear body language:
- exhausted, stressed, forced smile, tight jaw, side-eye, clenched teeth
- head-in-hands, slumped shoulders, hunched posture over paperwork
- fake-positive “yes boss” energy while obviously miserable
- passive-aggressive office politeness, thinly veiled resentment

Good “comedy beats”:
- employee fake-smiling at their boss while hiding scissors behind their back
- clerk overwhelmed by forms that multiply off the desk
- someone stamping “APPROVED” on nonsense with dead eyes (no readable text)
- coworker quietly shredding documents while maintaining eye contact

## Scene Variety (not just the office)
Keep the bureaucracy vibe, but vary locations:
- crowded office, records room, hallway, break room
- city sidewalk, bus stop, post office, coffee shop, park bench
- government building lobby, DMV-like waiting area, security checkpoint

## Visual Constraints
- No readable text, no logos, no watermarks.
- Keep composition clean and graphic (readable silhouette + clear focal point).
- If a person is present, face should be visible enough to read emotion.

## Prompt Recipe (for `Subject / Scene`)
Write 1–2 sentences worth of comma-separated fragments:
1) **Who** (optional): “frazzled clerk”, “stern supervisor”, “overworked office worker”
2) **Emotion/gesture**: “forced smile”, “grimacing”, “head in hands”, “side-eye”
3) **Absurd bureaucratic prop/action**: forms, stamps, filing cabinets, shredders, red tape
4) **Location**: office / street / coffee shop / park etc.
5) **Lighting/composition**: “hard desk lamp shadows”, “clean graphic composition”, “medium shot”

Example structure:
- `overworked clerk, forced smile, hiding scissors behind back, standing beside stern supervisor, stacks of forms, office hallway, hard shadows`

## Example Subjects (copy/paste starters)
- `frazzled office worker, head in hands, paperwork avalanche sliding off desk, rubber stamp in the foreground, records room, hard desk lamp shadows`
- `nervous clerk, fake smile, hiding scissors behind back, stern boss with clipboard, stacks of forms, office hallway, medium shot`
- `tired bureaucrat on a park bench, briefcase spilling forms, forced smile at a passing supervisor, city park, late afternoon shadows`
- `coffee shop counter, exhausted worker clutching a stack of forms like a coffee order, barista unimpressed, street scene visible through window`
- `city sidewalk, filing cabinet on a hand truck, frustrated employee dragging it uphill, papers fluttering, dramatic simple composition`
- `waiting room full of blank-faced people holding identical forms, one person side-eyeing the camera, subtle absurdity, clean graphic composition`
## House Style (base prompt)
Use this as the fixed “house style” prefix. Keep *specific subjects/locations/actions* in the per-card `Subject / Scene` prompt.

**Positive base**
- `Ink art of [subject with attitude], [action/pose energy], [max 2 environment props], [lighting mood], [1 or 2 optional accent colors to focus on], graphic novel illustration, bold ink outlines, flat colors, limited color palette, high contrast, clean linework, strong silhouette, dramatic lighting, professional comic art`

**Negative base**
- `photorealistic, 3d render, anime, manga, soft gradients, painterly, watercolor, airbrush, neon colors, bright saturated colors, glowing effects, fantasy lighting, blur, bokeh, soft focus, watermark, logo, speech bubbles, text, letters, numbers, extra limbs, deformed hands, extra fingers, bad anatomy, duplicate figures, multiple people unless specified`


## People Ratio (60/40)
Aim for **~60% of cards with no people** in the artwork (object/scenery focused), and **~40% with people**.

Reason: SDXL Lightning tends to fumble hands/faces more often; we get better consistency by leaning on props, environments, and absurd object gags.

Pipeline note:
- Use `contains_people = false` on cards that should avoid humans (the generator adds extra “no people” negatives).
- Leave \\contains_people\\ unset / null (People In Art = Auto) to let the generator auto-balance toward the target mix; set it to true/false only when you want to force it.
